    "My name is Aj, I have been in the real estate industry for 15+ years. I started as a real estate agent and was licensed in both Arizona and California throughout my career. I took pride in the exceptional service I offered my clients and soon found out I could maintain that level of service through the lending side of the transaction as well. I quickly grew my lending business as I truly loved helping my clients finance their dream homes. Around 2 years ago, I started to focus full time on my mortgage business, when I quickly realized my experience as a Real Estate Agent was not going to be wasted as a loan officer. It actually helped me provide a far better service to agents and borrowers by understanding all aspects of the real estate transaction from start to finish. That helped me grow my business with loyal agents and amazing client relationships. Which has then led me to NAK Mortgage. Working with Katie Compton and our similar values and goes when it comes to customer service and the mortgage business. We knew we could do great things and build a successful business with each other's help! We look forward to helping you with any financing needs you may have and always being ready to provide the level of knowledge and service you want and need in a mortgage lender.",
